              <h3>Education</h3>
              <p>
                I started my Software Engineering journey in winter 2015 at
                University of Regina. It took me almost six years to finish my
                degree (longer than usual), not because I’m slacking/failing my
                classes, but I had to work full-time while maintaining a status
                of “full-time” student. So, at most I was taking three classes
                per semester. After all that struggle… in 2021, I finally did it
                and completed my degree!

              <h3>Internship</h3>
              <p>
                In 2019, I was fortunate enough to work at eHealth Saskatchewan
                for my internship. My position there was IT Service Desk Analyst
                which is mainly to provide trouble-shooting support to our
                users. Besides being an IT, I was also assigned to develop UI/UX
                to their existing application.

              <h3>What I'm Doing</h3>
              <p>
                I was planning to go for vacation right after I graduate, but
                due to pandemic I cannot do that anymore. So, instead of doing
                nothing at home, I decided to focus and enhance my development
                skills by creating new projects and review data structures and
                algorithms.
